# USpring Documentation

Welcome to the USpring documentation! This folder contains comprehensive documentation for the USpring system, a physically-based spring animation library for Unity.

## Documentation Files

- [**USpring-Architecture-Overview.md**](USpring-Architecture-Overview.md): A high-level overview of the USpring architecture, explaining the core components and how they interact.
- [**USpring-API-Documentation.md**](USpring-API-Documentation.md): Detailed documentation of the core interfaces and classes in the USpring system.
- [**USpring-Usage-Guide.md**](USpring-Usage-Guide.md): Comprehensive guide with examples for using USpring in your projects.
- [**USpring-Patterns-AntiPatterns.md**](USpring-Patterns-AntiPatterns.md): Recommended patterns and anti-patterns to follow when using USpring.

## Getting Started

If you're new to USpring, we recommend starting with the [Architecture Overview](USpring-Architecture-Overview.md) to understand the system's design, followed by the [Usage Guide](USpring-Usage-Guide.md), which provides a step-by-step introduction to using USpring in your projects.

For a quick reference of the API, see the [API Documentation](USpring-API-Documentation.md).

## Additional Resources

- The original README file in the parent directory provides a concise overview of the system.
- The XML documentation in the code itself provides detailed information about specific methods and classes.
- The demo scenes in the `Assets/Demos/USpring/Scenes` folder provide practical examples of USpring in action.

## Key Features of USpring

- **Natural Motion**: Creates organic, bouncy animations superior to linear interpolation.
- **Responsive**: Springs dynamically react to changes in target values.
- **Component-Based**: Offers easy-to-use components for common Unity properties (Transform, UI, Color, etc.).
- **Scriptable**: Provides core spring classes (`SpringFloat`, `SpringVector3`, etc.) for direct use in scripts.
- **Skeletal System**: Includes `SpringSkeleton` and `SpringBone` for physics-based secondary animation on character rigs.
- **Customizable**: Fine-tune spring behavior with Force, Drag, Clamping, and Events.
- **Efficient**: Utilizes stable numerical integration suitable for real-time use.

## Common Use Cases

USpring is ideal for a wide range of animation needs:

- **UI Animation**: Create responsive, natural-feeling UI elements.
- **Camera Effects**: Implement smooth camera movements and shake effects.
- **Character Animation**: Add secondary motion to characters and objects.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provide organic visual feedback for user interactions.
- **Procedural Animation**: Generate dynamic, physically-based animations at runtime.
